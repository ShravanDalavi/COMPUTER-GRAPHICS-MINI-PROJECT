## Overview:
- Objective: Generate visual representations of fractals, such as the Mandelbrot or Julia sets.
- Requirements: You will need Python with libraries like numpy and matplotlib for plotting.
- Concept: Fractals are self-similar patterns that exhibit the same shape at different scales. The Mandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers for which a function does not diverge when iterated.
## Requirements:
- Python installed on your system.
- Python libraries: numpy and matplotlib.
- You can install the required libraries with:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
## Explanation:
1. mandelbrot(c, max_iter): Computes the number of iterations required for a complex number c to escape (if it exceeds a modulus of 2). This function determines if a point belongs to the Mandelbrot set.
2. generate_fractal(): Creates a 2D grid of complex numbers and evaluates each using the `mandelbrot` function.
3. Plotting with Matplotlib: Displays the fractal image using a colormap.
## Lab Requirements:
Use the provided code to explore different fractals by changing parameters (like `x_min`, `x_max`, etc.).
Experiment with different color maps and iteration limits (`max_iter`) to see their effects on the fractal's appearance.
