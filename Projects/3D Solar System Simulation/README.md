# Overview:
- Objective: Simulate the orbits of planets around the Sun using basic Newtonian mechanics.
- Requirements: Python with vpython library for 3D graphics and numpy for numerical computations.
- Concept: Each planet is treated as a point mass orbiting the Sun, following elliptical orbits defined by Kepler's laws.

# Requirements:
1. Python Installed: Make sure Python is installed.
2. Install Required Libraries: Install vpython and numpy using:
```bash
pip install vpython numpy
```
